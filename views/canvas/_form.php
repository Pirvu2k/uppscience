                Earlier in this form you wrote about technical resources/key activities and external help that you would need to make the project a reality.<br />
                What you have put in that part can help you identify the costs of your project.<br />
                Depending on what project idea you are sharing you can either make an estimate of cost of the project as a whole or of every unit if it is about a product that can be mass produced.<br />
                These are estimates but do make some research or ask for help should you be in contact with someone who can help you with this part.<br />
                Do not leave out the work that experts need to carry out or if there is maintenance that will be required.<br />
                No one expects you to be an economist but take time to think about all the costs so that the person looking at your project idea sees that you have looked into the possibility of making this idea a reality.

            <p> Who could pay for buying or using your product/service? <span class="requiredquestion">*</span></p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                This question is asking you who is your client if the result can be sold be it a tangible product or a service. You can also take it to mean who would finance the project especially if it is a project that is infrastructural and therefore one could possibly sell it only once.<br />
                In some cases you can take a dual approach. You can imagine selling the product or service directly to the ultimate client or you could image that a brand buys it and sells it to its client base.<br />
                In any case if a brand is buying your product or service to resell it you still need to convince the brand to buy it and you need to think of who is the individual or company that would be ready to pay and how much.<br />
                Think of things like whether your client or the ultimate client would pay once for a service, or for a subscription or periodically.

            <p> Will the project create income? How? <span class="requiredquestion">*</span></p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                There are products or services that can be sold but there are others that pertain to a social service so the ultimate client would not be paying for them. A public authority could buy or pay for it instead.<br />
                There are products or services that are not a basic need or not a need at tall so no one would buy it out of need but they could make an improvement on something and could make an attractive or entertaining gadget that can be bought and given out as a public relations or marketing opportunity by your client.<br />
                If you are selling the product or service to your client you could identify the price and according to the price you can even calculate what kind of client would buy it. You could identify what income bracket your client would have based on the kind of product and the minimum price at which it would be sold.<br />
                This question is important for someone to look into the economic viability of your project idea.
